## Features
**Automatic Time Allocation**: Enter your total work hours for the day, and the app automatically divides the time for your three main tasks in a 3:2:1 ratio.

**Pomodoro Mode**: Switch from a standard hours/minutes view to Pomodoro sessions (25-minute work intervals).

**Misc. Task Budgeting**: Allocate time for smaller, miscellaneous tasks. This time is subtracted from your main work block, giving you a realistic view of your day.

**Local Storage**: Your tasks and settings are saved in your browser, so your session persists even if you close the tab.

**Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
Set Your Work Hours: In the "Total Work Hours Today" input, set the total amount of time you have available.

Define Your Top 3 Tasks: Fill in your Most Important Task (MIT), your second MIT, and your third MIT in the pyramid. The time will be calculated for you.

Add Misc. Tasks: If you have smaller to-dos, add them to the "Misc. List" and set the time required. This will adjust the time available for your main tasks.

Switch to Pomodoro Mode: Use the "Hours" / "Pomodoros" toggle to see your time broken down into focus sessions.
